# ArbitrageBetting

This is an ongoing project for my own interest/practice. The goal is to 
write a program which will scrape betting odds of various websites, and
then present me with the best arbitrage opportunities that exist for those
odds. This project is unlikely to actually make me (or you) much money at all,
unless you have obscenely large amounts of money at your disposal. This is 
because arbitrage opportunities tend to have ROIs less than 5%. The goal is
to improve my python, so read and use it with that in mind.
